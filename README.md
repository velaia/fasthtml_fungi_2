# fasthtml-fungi-2 - My Mushroom Map

## Description

This application allows users to upload photos of mushrooms they have found. Upon uploading, the app will automatically extract the GPS coordinates from the EXIF data embedded in the photos. Using these coordinates, the app will then display a map highlighting the locations of all the mushroom observations. This feature enables users to easily visualize where different types of mushrooms have been found.

## Installation

* Clone this git repository, e.g. using `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/velaia/fasthtml_fungi_2`.

NB: The installation with rye (and uv) seems to be way faster (3.9s compared to 9.2 for pip).

### Using Rye

* Make sure to [have rye installed](https://rye.astral.sh/guide/installation/) (together with `uv` it's pip on steroids (and more)!)
* `cd fasthtml_fungi_2` into the cloned repository
* `rye sync`
* Active the newly created virtualenv (e.g. `source .venv/bin/activate`)
* Run the program with `rye run fasthtml-fungi-2` and open the [displayed URL](http://localhost:5001) in your browser to add your first mushroom observation

### Using pip

* `cd fasthtml_fungi_2` into the cloned repository
* `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate` to create a virtual environment and activate it
* `pip install -r requirements.lock` to install the dependencies
* `python src/fasthtml_fungi_2/__init__.py` to run the program, then open the [displayed URL](http://localhost:5001) in your browser to add your first mushroom observation

### Using Docker

## Configuration
You can adjust settings in the `.env` file, e.g. [choose a different Stadia Maps theme](https://docs.stadiamaps.com/themes/).


## Technology

This is a pet project of mine to explore a couple of tools I've been wanting to explore for a while in combination with my interest in üçÑ mushrooms üçÑ.

## TODOs
* [x] Motivation
* [x] pip installation instructions
* [ ] Dockerfile & instructions
* [x] What (else) to put in dotfile? Clean up uploads directory config.
* [ ] Create demo online using railway.app
* [ ] Include screenshot or short video of the app
* [x] Add LICENSE
* [x] Complete pyproject.toml with relevant meta data
* [ ] Add footer (to all pages!)
* [x] Investigate issue with toasts [and session](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fasthtml/issues/247); [new issue created](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fasthtml/issues/297)
* [ ] Test rye build; how could it be used to distribute the app through PyPI as standalone app?
* [ ] Add version increment to project (e.g. [python-versioneer](https://github.com/python-versioneer/python-versioneer) or [bump-my-version](https://github.com/callowayproject/bump-my-version))
