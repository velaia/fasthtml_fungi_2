# fasthtml-fungi-2 - Personal Fungi

Pet project to explore a couple of tools I wanted to explore (for  a while) in combination with üçÑ mushroomsüçÑ:
* [Answer.ai's FastHTML](https://fastht.ml/)
* [Rye: a Hassle-Free Python Experience](https://rye.astral.sh/)
* [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
* [icecream](https://github.com/gruns/icecream) & [dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv)

## Description

This application allows users to upload photos of mushrooms they have found. Upon uploading, the app will automatically extract the GPS coordinates from the EXIF data embedded in the photos. Using these coordinates, the app will then display a map highlighting the locations of all the mushroom observations. This feature enables users to easily visualize where different types of mushrooms have been found.
